As a school we have ensured that a member of our staff, (Designated Safeguarding Lead- Ms Kate Fischer) known as a Key Adult, has been trained in the Operation Encompass procedures allowing us to then use the information that has been shared, in confidence, to support the children in our care.<br><br>The Domestic Abuse Act 2021 identifies children who experience domestic abuse as victims of domestic abuse in their own right.
