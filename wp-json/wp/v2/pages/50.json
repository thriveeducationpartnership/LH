Parents\/carers will be asked to send in proof of the appointment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents\/carers are asked to make routine medical appointments outside of the school day. School expects all pupils attending medical appointments during the school day to attend school before\/after the appointment where at all possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If absence from school is needed for religious festivals or family events, parents\/carers are asked to please contact school in advance and request permission for the leave from the Head Teacher. Parents\/carers can write to the Head Teacher directly. Alternatively, parents\/carers can request from the school office a \u2018leave during term time request form\u2019 to complete and return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to approve term time holidays has been removed from the Head Teacher\u2019s powers of discretion and term time holidays will be marked as unauthorised absence. The Head Teacher will carefully consider all parental requests for leave during term time but can only authorise where there are exceptional circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>School attendance and levels of absence are regularly monitored by the school and where attendance is a concern, school will work closely with parents and children to improve the situation. Parents\/carers need to be aware that school may need to work with other agencies if attendance of their child at school is of concern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the school\u2019s legal duty to report to the Local Authority where children are missing from school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"767\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2025\/02\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2605\" srcset=\"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2025\/02\/image.png 767w, https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2025\/02\/image-300x264.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hospital Appointments<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pupils sometimes have to attend off site clinics or hospitals for a variety of reasons. If a child has a hospital appointment, parents\/carers should let school know as far in advance as possible and keep their child\u2019s time taken off school to an absolute minimum. Pupils are expected to attend school in the morning if they have an afternoon appointment and similarly to attend school in the afternoon following a morning appointment. School will ask for proof of the appointment in advance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lea Hall Academy daily internal procedures are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"779\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2025\/07\/image-779x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2775\" style=\"width:656px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2025\/07\/image-779x1024.png 779w, https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2025\/07\/image-228x300.png 228w, https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2025\/07\/image-768x1010.png 768w, https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2025\/07\/image.png 1065w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Regular school attendance is vital for ensuring continuity for all children.
