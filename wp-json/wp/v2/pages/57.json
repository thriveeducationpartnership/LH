This might be for example, a specialist chair and tray to support learning in class and\/or a standing frame to practice weight bearing and standing. Some children may also have walking frames and specialist footwear as needed. Teachers and support staff in class are instructed in how to position children by the Physiotherapist or their assistant and they are then responsible for implementing any physiotherapy programmes. The Bridge School has a range of hoists to facilitate the safe manual handling of children and all staff physically assisting children with transfers are trained in the safe manual handling of children with special needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Speech and Language Therapy (SALT)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Speech and Language Therapy (SALT)<\/em><\/strong> \u2013 is available to children who are assessed as needing it. Following a referral, Speech and Language Therapists will assess individual children and will write targets for them that are specific to their needs. &nbsp;Communication aids are developed for those children who are non-verbal. A range of systems of communication such as Makaton and PECS are used and at every opportunity, children are encouraged to be as independent as possible with their communication. NHS Speech and Language Therapists also support individual children experiencing difficulties with their eating and drinking (dysphagia).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Occupational Therapy (OT)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Occupational Therapy (OT)<\/em> \u2013<\/strong> School liaises with professionals from different branches of OT.
