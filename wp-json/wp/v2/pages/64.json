Celebrations are also highlights. Parents\/carers are also invited to attend parents\u2019 evenings early in the school year. This is an important meeting, especially if the child is new to the school or has changed class or teacher. A parents\u2019 evening is also held in the spring term to inform parents\/carers of their child\u2019s progress during the year. Parents\/carers are welcome to meet teachers outside of formal meetings such as parents\u2019 evenings and EHCP reviews but do need to book in advance an appointment that is outside of lesson time to avoid disruption to learning time. Communication is a two-way process and parents\/carers are kindly asked to make a reciprocal commitment. To this end, various mechanisms have been put into place to ensure good communication between home and school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Verbal or written&nbsp;<strong>messages<\/strong>&nbsp;may be communicated via the escort staff on home to school transport.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Letters<\/strong>&nbsp;may be sent by post to or from the school.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Telephone<\/strong>&nbsp;messages may be sent to or from the school.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>E-mail<\/strong>&nbsp;messages may be sent to or from the school.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Parents may&nbsp;<strong>visit<\/strong>&nbsp;the school in person to raise any matter of concern with senior staff.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Parents\u2019 evenings<\/strong>&nbsp;are arranged, to provide parents\/carers with an opportunity to talk to staff<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lea Hall Academy prides itself on being a community that extends to parents\/carers, families and beyond.
