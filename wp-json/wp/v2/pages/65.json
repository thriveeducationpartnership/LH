Each pupil has an Individual Education Plan which is reviewed on a termly basis and communicated to parents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the special educational needs of a child may change, their Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) may become inaccurate and need amending. For this reason, the special needs of every pupil are reviewed once every year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All parents and carers are required to attend the Review Meeting which is set up to discuss their child\u2019s placement and progress. Individual Education Plans and amendments to the Education, Health and Care Plan are also agreed at this meeting for consideration by the Local Authority. Information is then confirmed and communicated both to parents and the school by the Local Authority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All parents and carers receive a detailed report at the end of the year in addition to the information provided by the teacher in attendance at the review meeting.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EHCP (Education, Health and Care Plans) are reviewed once every year. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":311,"parent":45,"menu_order":2,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-65","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"acf":{"sidebar":true,"landing_page":false},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/65"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=65"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/65\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":281,"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/65\/revisions\/281"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/45"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/311"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/leahall.fet.ac\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=65"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
