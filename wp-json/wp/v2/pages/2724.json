These include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Having a strong Aims and Ethos which pervades our school.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Focusing on core values.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exploring other cultures and religions and promoting diversity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Challenging prejudices and racist comments.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Developing critical thinking skills and a strong, positive self-identity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Promoting the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils, as well as British values such as democracy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We will also protect children from the risk of radicalisation, for example by using filters on the internet to make sure they can\u2019t access extremist and terrorist material, or by vetting visitors who come into school to work with pupils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different schools will carry out the Prevent duty in different ways, depending on the age of the children and the needs of the community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Isn\u2019t my child too young to learn about extremism?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prevent strategy is not just about discussing extremism itself, which may not be appropriate for younger children. It is also about teaching children values such as tolerance and mutual respect. This is what we will focus on at Lea Hall Academy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The school will make sure any discussions are suitable for the age and maturity of the children involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is extremism really a risk in our area?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Extremism can take many forms, including political, religious and misogynistic extremism. Some of these may be a bigger threat in our area than others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will endeavour to give children the skills to protect them from any extremist views they may encounter, now or later in their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Further information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact the school&nbsp;\u2013 If you have any questions or concerns about the Prevent Strategy and what it means for your child, please do not hesitate to contact the school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See our policies&nbsp;\u2013 You will find more details about radicalisation in our safeguarding policy, available on our website.
