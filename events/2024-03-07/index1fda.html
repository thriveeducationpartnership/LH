SUMMARY:World Book Day!
DESCRIPTION:On Thursday 7th March\, we’re celebrating World Book Day\, which provides a fantastic opportunity for our children to share with us their favourite books\, whether it’s an epic fantasy adventure or an encyclopaedia! Books are a great way to learn about the world around us\, spark our imagination and further our understanding of topics that interest us.  \nWe have an extensive collection of books at Lea Hall Academy  in order to cater to our diverse range of pupils\, each with their own unique reading preferences and capabilities. There really is something for everyone when it comes to books\, and we love being a part of each child’s reading journey. \nTo celebrate World Book Day this year we are asking our students to come into school dressed as their favourite ‘Sports Hero’ and to bring in their favourite book to share with their class.  \nWe look forward to a brilliant week celebrating books! \nIf you’d like to know how you can get involved at home\, you can find resources for families here: https://www.worldbookday.com/families/  \n
